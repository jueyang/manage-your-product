## Demo Day, August 4

Keep your demos to the point. You are not only presenting to you fellow students, but also guests and possibly community members. 

## Format

You will have 5 minutes to present and 2 mintues of Q&A. For those of you who have sites built from scratch, that will be the main thing you show. Some of you might be showing your work via:

- iframe embedded in an existing site
- a feature added to, or using, an exisiting site
- logged communication with key team members
- paper

## Guidelines

- Stick to the 5 mintues you have. You will have a 1-minute reminder as you approach the end of your presentation. If you go over into your Q&A minutes, you will not get those mintues back.
- Demo the product first. Whether you created a site, a map, a paper survey kit, show what you have done, as opposed to what you plan to finish.
- Keep the context and process of your product concise, and only include them after you finish presenting your product itself.

## Why the guidelines

- You hone your elevator pitch to strangers.
- You make it possible for people to focus. (Remember there are 14 of you!)

Once everyone finishes their main demo, you can discuss uncovered topics of your product in a more relaxed atmosphere with the rest of the class and guests.

## Peer rating

You will be rating both the presentation and the product of your peers. Fork this [gist](https://gist.github.com/jueyang/8a5ef44df49c48cb276e) and fill in the fields. You will DM me your gist by the end of this Friday (Aug 7). Whether or not you make the gist public/private is up to you!
