## Hello!

This is a repository for the Product Management class for the Social Journalism program. 

## Communication

Over the course of the class you will learn to communicate with developers to make your (and the community you work with) vision come true. 

We are using [Slack](https://slack.com/) and GitHub (right here!) for this class. These two platforms make our communication as efficient and effective as possible. 

- Slack: general communication, questions, logistics, etc
- GitHub: discussion about product features, feedback, tracking progress

Please download the [Slack Desktop App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12). It will make your life easier.
