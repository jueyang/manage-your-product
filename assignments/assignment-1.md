## Persona and user story

You have been working with your community and identified a need they have. To help you make design decisions for your product, it's helpful to imagine (or, partially test your product on paper) how your product would actually work for your community.

To do this, we are borrowing a design method from service design called **persona**. The personas are archetypes built after an exhaustive observation of the potential users. While persona is fictional in a more traditional design process, it will be a real person from the community in your case.

## Deliverables

1. Write up a few paragraphs about how your persona would use your product. Describe:
  - their social/demographic background; their story, if you will
  - how they come to discover this product
  - why they would want to use it
  - their process of using the product (click this button, fill in that form, etc)
  - actions they can take as/after they use the product (conduct a lawyer, tweet, etc)
2. Include a diagram of the persona's experience of using the product. Think about explaining the user story visually.
  - e.g. If the persona is going through multiple screens to reach a conclusion, what screens are they experiencing?

## How to deliver

Write in your favorite text editor, and draw with any tools you feel comfortable with. (If you're not familiar with any graphic software, or would rather sketch with a pencil, which is great, feel free to take photos of your sketches.)

Deliever your writing and diagram as a markdown file (.md) in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/). For images you can first upload them to [imgur](http://imgur.com/), [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/), or use Dropbox's public folder. Copy the image url and insert it with markdown in your gist.

You will send me the url to your final gist. **It is due on Thursday, June 11th.**
