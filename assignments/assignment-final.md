## Plans for your product

This assignment will help you package what you have so far and move on to product release/launch. Although your product is derived from your community needs, and does not necessarily have a deadline, you should have a definitive shipping strategy: for testing your hypothesis, furthering your connection with your community, or just simply, adding a finished product to your portfolio.

### Recommended actions if you are using a github repo for your product

Include a `README.md` in the predominant branch. (For example, if you are hosting on `gh-pages`, include the `README.md` there.)

The `README.md` serves as an introduction of your product to potential collaborators. It should briefly describe what the product is and what technology/data is used.* To see an example, check out the [Quartz Chartbuilder `README.md`](https://github.com/Quartz/Chartbuilder#chartbuilder-chart_with_upwards_trend).

If you have done data-related work, a specific log of how you procured and manipulated the data will be very useful. Unclear data sources and processes will reduce the creidibility of the product and make it harder for others to contribute.

*=If you don't know exactly what the technology/data has been implemented, open an issue and assign it to the person responsible for buildling.

## How to deliver

DM the gist to Jue in Slack before **9pm on Monday, Aug 10**.
