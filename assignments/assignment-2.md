## Wireframe and product scope

For this assignment, you will:

1. create a set of detailed wireframes (and, for some of you, a user journey diagram) based on our latest round of discussion, and
2. write up a product scope.

Use what you learned from the [lecture this week](https://github.com/jueyang/manage-your-product/blob/master/week3-wireframes.md), convey three aspects of your product:

- the architecture and depth of your site
- the layout of the site
- the interactions that happen on the site

## Deliverables

### Part 1: Wireframes/paper prototype

Use whatever tool that suits your needs. Unlike the sketch-y diagram you did last time, this set of wireframes should be legible, and contain visual/text explanations where you see fit.

The wireframes you make will be the base of our review next week. Make them so that you can articulate your whole product to someone who does not know you, or your product. (We have a guest critic next week, besides Conrad and myself.)

**Nuria and Deron** -- since your products involve systems that manage users, discussion, publishing (such as a CMS), etc, you will also create a detailed diagram demonstrating:

- the stakeholders involved in your product (including yourself)
- the information flow between the different stakeholders
- the platforms/tools used in the information flow

### Part 2: Scope

Fork the scope template and edit with your content under each category:

Read the instructions in the template.

## How to deliver

For wireframes/paper prototypes/diagrams, we will further workshop them in the review during class next week. Bring all materials to class.

For the scope template, please send the gist link in the #assignment-2 channel in Slack. **This is due before late night on Monday, June 22.**

## Tips on creating wireframes

- Keep the size of all of your screens consistent.
- Use a grid if you can.
- Browse wireframes on [pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=wireframe), [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/search?q=wireframe), and [behance](https://www.behance.net/collection/wireframes-amp-flows/10368863) for presentation techniques/inspiration.
